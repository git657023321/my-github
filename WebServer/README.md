# my-github
this is my github for learning and exercising,there are something I had done.

#the program of webserver 
this is my program of webserver to practice something that i had got. 
this program uses epoll/io reuseable model and threadpool technology to work on Linux as one  webserver that
supports GET way to get something you want.but,the other way of getting http source don't come ture. 
it can be tested by using one brower to get in one website as http://192.168.101.22:8080/?/index.html if you have interests.
and the ip is the one of your computer,the port is the one you will have been set.

#what I got after this program
yeah, I had got many things after working for this program about a week. but,what is that. i can't say what is it exactly .
in all ,i had learn more thing during the work of this program. i like one word of Pony Ma that the thing you work don't cares about 
where it comes from,the most important thing is that the thing works.
