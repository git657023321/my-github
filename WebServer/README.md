# my-github
This is my github repository for learning and exercising, there are something I had done.

# the program of webserver 
This is a program of web server to practice something that i had got in the fouth year of collage.
The program used non-blocking IO, IO multiplexing, and the threadpool methon to work on Linux as one webserver that just
supports the methon of GET. So, the other methon of HTTP did not make sure. The program can be tested by browing a URL http://192.168.101.22:8080/?/index.html on brower, if you have interests. And the ip address is one of your computer, the port is that you have been set.

# what I got after this program
Yeah, I had got some things after working for this program about a week. but, what is that. I could't say what is it exactly.
In all, the time of working for this program was actual, and I would benefit a lot from it.
